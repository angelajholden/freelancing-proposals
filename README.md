# Freelance Proposal Archive (2015‚Äì2018)

This is a collection of 15 real proposals I wrote during my first three years as a freelance frontend developer. These are actual documents I sent to clients ‚Äî redacted and anonymized, but otherwise untouched.

üßæ These proposals cover a wide range of client projects:

-   Custom WordPress sites
-   Membership and eCommerce builds
-   SEO audits and ongoing maintenance
-   Coaching, branding, and print collateral

All files are shared as PDFs, formatted like a normal document (not a fancy slide deck). I‚Äôve always written proposals like memorandums ‚Äî clear, professional and focused on deliverables. This format worked well for me.
