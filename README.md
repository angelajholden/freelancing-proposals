# Freelance Proposal Archive (2015–2018)

This is a collection of 15 real proposals I wrote during my first three years as a freelance frontend developer. These are actual documents I sent to clients — redacted and anonymized, but otherwise untouched.

🧾 These proposals cover a wide range of client projects:

-   Custom WordPress sites
-   Membership and eCommerce builds
-   SEO audits and ongoing maintenance
-   Coaching, branding, and print collateral

All files are shared as PDFs, formatted like a normal document (not a fancy slide deck). I’ve always written proposals like memorandums — clear, professional and focused on deliverables. This format worked well for me.

In this full video, I walk through each proposal, explain the context, share what I’d do differently today, and talk about how my freelance mindset evolved over time.
